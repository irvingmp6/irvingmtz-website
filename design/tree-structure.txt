    |     +-- Hello. I’m Irving, and I’m a backend software engineer. I started my programming journey back in college when I took an intro to Java course. It was love at first sight—or should I say execution? Ahem…Anyway, shortly after college I ended up working different jobs where I looked for ways to apply my new skills and solve real business problems.
    |     |
    |     +-- I’ve had the privilege of working on dozens of challenging projects where I had to teach myself different tech stacks to get the job done. Slowly but surely, my programming skills got better and better to the point where I was finally confident enough to go for a software developer position. Needless to say, the hard work paid off.
    |     |
    |     +-- Today, I enjoy working as a Software Developer at Optum Financial. Here are some of the technologies I use day-to-day for work:
